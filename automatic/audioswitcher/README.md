## Audio Switcher

Easily switch the default audio device, input or output, on any Windows PC (Vista and above).

Using this application you can switch output OR input sound devices at the click of a button, or the press of a key.

I designed this application to be incredibly small and lightweight. There is no bloat, it does exactly what it should, nothing more, nothing less.
