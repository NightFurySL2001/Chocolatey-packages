    <description>Jacksum is a free and platform independent software for computing and verifying checksums, CRCs and message digests (known as hash values and fingerprints). "Jacksum" is a synthetic word made of **JA**va and Chec**KSUM**.

Jacksum supports **58 popular standard algorithms** (Adler32, BSD sum, Bzip2's CRC-32, POSIX cksum, CRC-8, CRC-16, CRC-24, CRC-32 (FCS-32), CRC-64, ELF-32, eMule/eDonkey, FCS-16, GOST R 34.11-94, HAS-160, HAVAL (3/4/5 passes, 128/160/192/224/256 bits), MD2, MD4, MD5, MPEG-2's CRC-32, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-256, RIPEMD-320, SHA-0, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Tiger-128, Tiger-160, Tiger, Tiger2, Tiger Tree Hash, Tiger2 Tree Hash, Unix System V sum, sum8, sum16, sum24, sum32, Whirlpool-0, Whirlpool-1, Whirlpool and xor8).

Jacksum supports the "Rocksoft (tm) Model CRC Algorithm", it can calculate **customized CRC algorithms** (all from 8 bit to 64 bit) and it supports the **combination of multiple algorithms**. Due to those features, **millions of different new algorithms** are possible.

Jacksum has opened it's source code and it is released under the terms of the GNU GPL. Jacksum is **OSI Certified Open Source Software**. OSI Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.

Jacksum is **platform independent**, because it is written entirely in the Java programming language, the software runs on any platform having a Java Runtime Environment.

Jacksum has multiple interfaces. It can be used on the command line, at your file browser/manager, and it can be found as engine also in many other software projects.
