## Mooncoin Wallet

Mooncoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Mooncoin is an open source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities. Mathematics secures the network and empowers individuals to control their own finances.

With over 384 billion MOON available, there is one coin for each millimeter of distance from the Earth to the Moon!

Mooncoin is intended to provide the thrill of big coin hunting and trading but with long-term stability. Based on sane block release targets, Mooncoin should provide years of good mining for all ages and equipment types.
