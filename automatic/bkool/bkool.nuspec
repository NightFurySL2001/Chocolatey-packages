Andy is an Android emulator that breaks down the barrier between desktop and mobile computing.  
By using virtualization features present in modern CPUs and leveraging the Virtualbox 
command-line interface, Andy creates virtual environments to run Android apps.

* Provides seamless sync between desktop and mobile devices
* Connects Win/Mac with Android apps for launching, push notifications and storage
* Enables app download from any desktop browser direct to Andy OS
* Ensures most up to date Android OS at all times
* Brings your favorite communication and entertainment mobile apps to the desktop
* Remote control: use your android device as control interface and view output on desktop. 
    With phone as a joystick, you will never have to sacrifice the multi-touch or gyro 
    elements of gaming, and thanks to seamless connection between desktop and mobile, you 
    can receive a SnapChat phone picture on the street and see it on your desktop at home.

#### Minimum requirements

* System hardware virtualization support:
  * CPU virtualization support (AMD AMD-V, Intel VT-x, or VIA VT)
  * Motherboard enabled (configured within BIOS/UEFI)
* 3GB RAM
* Up to 20GB free disk space
