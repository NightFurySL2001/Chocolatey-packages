## DNSQuerySniffer

DNSQuerySniffer is a network sniffer utility that shows the DNS queries sent on your system.

For every DNS query, the following information is displayed: Host Name, Port Number, Query ID, Request Type (A, AAAA, NS, MX, and so on), Request Time, Response Time, Duration, Response Code, Number of records, and  the content of the returned DNS records.

You can easily export the DNS queries information to csv/tab-delimited/xml/html file, or copy the DNS queries to the clipboard, and then paste them into Excel or other spreadsheet application.
